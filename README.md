# league-frontend

This project uses javascript to create a league of legends character card for each champion that was imported to the database.

This was designed using a JavaScript frontend, with a Ruby on Rails backend that was seeded by hand from the League of Legends champion list rather than importing the API from Riot Games directly, allowing for more customization.
